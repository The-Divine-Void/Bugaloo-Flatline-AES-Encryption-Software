this is just a testing software that has a 52 character encryption cipher made from 12 language alphabets
its AES GCM i believe and needs to have a copy and paste function which chatgpt says is fine but its obviously not
it totally defeats the purpose of encryption if u cant highlight the text and send it out or highlight it and copy and paste it so u can decrypt it
also for some reason my autohotkeys script i installed on my laptop isnt outputing the same alphabet i think becuz i might not have all the alphabets installed on pc
anyone can edit this and add to it please include me idc whos name is on this becuz AI wrote this im really smart but dont know how to code but im slowly learning...

there are some dependencies u must install or import idk what its called lol
they will throw errors when u try to run this so just install what it says is missing 

also there WAS a P2P peer to peer service part of this code gpt gave me but i couldnt get it to work on my home network from the laptop to the rasp pi so idk much about networking for setting up the ssh from person to person
but i wanna test it with someone else.
